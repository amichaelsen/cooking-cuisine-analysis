### Potential Stakeholders/Applications:
* Recipe Hosting Websites trying to automatically tag/predict cuisines of new recipes 
  * Could also use similar clustering techniques to generate recipe lists (wihtin or between cuisines) 
* For people looking to cook, could input a list of ingredients they have and get recommendations for what cuisine they might make and what other ingredients they could use with it
* Apps/Platforms with grocery lists could identify which cuisine you are most aligned with and recommend other ingredients relevant to that cuisine
  *  They could also target ads for restaurants of those cuisines 
* Restaurant apps (e.g. delivery platforms or Yelp) could identify which cuisines people like and then recommend adjacent cuisines using the cuisine clustering
